## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This project was made with 3 other teammates, we each had our specialties and I was in charge of coding the multiplayer aspects. This project was our final project to show what we learned during or "Gaming with unity" class. 

These were the requirements :

We also had to present this project to the class and explain our code and what we have done. 

## Built With

- Used Unity

- Used Unity Multiplayer

- Used C#

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- First you need to have unity installed, we used version 2022.2.2f1, to avoid any problems I recommend using the same.

```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/DylanBrass/Final_Game_Project.git

## Usage

- To use the game to play with a friend you need to build it
- To build you simply do CTRL + b
- When prompted to select a folder choose an empty one (create one)
- The game will then open !

### For Multiplayer
- Simply follow the same steps on another computer
- This game works only with LAN (We do not have dedicated servers), this means both PC's must be on the same WIFI
- One player clicks host
- The host sends the IP to the other player to copy (there's a copy button, it will lag your game)
- The Second player (or more) puts the IP in here :

- Then click join and voila !
