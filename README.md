## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This project was made with 3 other teammates, we each had our specialties and I was in charge of coding the multiplayer aspects. This project was our final project to show what we learned during or "Gaming with unity" class. 

These were the requirements :

We also had to present this project to the class and explain our code and what we have done.
